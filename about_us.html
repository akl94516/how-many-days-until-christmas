		<p id="aboutustext">Hi There! Thank you for visiting my website “How Many Days Until...” My name is Tony Lopez
			and I created this website as a project for my “Design For the Web I” class. The theme and function of the
			website came about because my daughter Eva always kept asking me “how many days until Christmas?” so I
			thought it would be a fun to create a website that would answer this question and maybe some other dates
			that have also come up. Hope you enjoy it!</p>
